### 🎯 **Overview:**
In this project, I a deep neural network model to predict patient mortality from time series data contained in patient records.
The purpose of building such a model, is to provide an analytic framework that medical professionals can use to predict patient mortality at any time of interest. Such a solution provides essential feedback to clinicians when trying to assess the impact of treatment decisions, or raise early warning signs to flag at-risk patients in a busy hospital care setting.
